# YouTube-Mockup
Mockup YouTube using HTML and CSS


This project is a simple mockup of the YouTube interface built using HTML and CSS. It includes a fixed header for the logo, search bar, and user icons, as well as a vertical sidebar with navigation links. The main content area showcases a grid of video previews that adapts to different screen sizes. Several CSS files were used to separate styling for the header, sidebar, and video grid, with different layout techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid. All icons and images are placed in dedicated folders.
